# Email-Phishing-Detection-Using-AI_ML
The task of our project is to detect phishing emails effectively using various machine learning algorithms.
Let us first understand the meaning of phishing attack, in cybersecurity terms, phishing is a cybercrime that is intended to steal sensitive information of the user to perform some malicious activities.
It can lead to account takeover, privilege escalation and many other vulnerabilities can be caused by performing phishing attack.
The attacker tend to behave as an authorized source and directly communicates with the user. 
This is a well-known attack and in corporate we tend to get tons of such phishing emails. In order to minimise it, our idea is to detect these phishing mails efficiently so that it gets handled properly by the organisations or the respective individual. 

Hence to manage the detection of phishing mails efficiently we have implemented AI and Machine Learning algorithms with the help of NLP to achieve high accuracy and precision in identifying the novel phishing approaches into our system.
